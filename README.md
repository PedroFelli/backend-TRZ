# TRZ (The Resident Zombie) - Frontend

## Problem Description

The world, as we know it, has fallen into an apocalyptic scenario. The "Influenzer T-Virus" (a.k.a. Twiter Virus) is transforming human beings into stupid beasts (a.k.a. Zombies), hungry to cancel humans and eat their limbs.

You, the last survivor who knows how to code, will help the resistance by deploying a system to connect the remaining humans. This system will be essential to detect new infections and share resources between the members.
